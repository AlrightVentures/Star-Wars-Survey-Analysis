# Star-Wars-Survey-Analysis
The team at FiveThirtyEight collected data to answer one question: Does the rest of America think that “The Empire Strikes Back” is the best of the Star Wars movies? To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which I downloaded from their GitHub repository.

In this project I clean and explore the data set in Jupyter notebook.

The data has several columns, including:

- RespondentID - An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)
- Gender - The respondent's gender
- Age - The respondent's age
- Household Income - The respondent's income
- Education - The respondent's education level
- Location (Census Region) - The respondent's location
- Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? - Has a Yes or No response
- Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? - Has a Yes or No response

There are several other columns containing answers to questions about the Star Wars movies. For some questions, the respondent had to check one or more boxes. This type of data is difficult to represent in columnar format. As a result, this data set needs a lot of cleaning.
